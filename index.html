      <h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
      <p>I am Yashodhan Bhatawdekar and I am Currently pursuing an Electronics and Communication engineering degree from NIT Warangal. I am a keen learner who strives to take and solve problems. Time-management, problem solving and integrity are some of the skills that make me whole.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I learned HTML5 recently and this particular website is my third project in total. I am learning more on Web Development by the day and honing my skills. I found Web Development coding to be much intuitive and easier than normal C++ as there is much less logic involved. Hence, I feel this is a language any student can learn and master with regular practice and consistency. </p>
        <img class="CSS" src="images/css.png" alt="css">
        <br>
        <p>CSS3 is something that I found incredibly empowering towards HTML as it completely changes the way webpages look and feel, not just to the viewer but the designer as well. I am regularly learning CSS and continuously implementing it on my websites both newer and older ones!</p>
        <img class="CPP" src="images/c++.png" alt="cpp">
        <br>
        <p>C++ is an extremely handy skill that according to me each and every programmer must learn. Derived directly from the mother of all programming languages "C", C++ has intense uses in game development and other useful tasks. I learned this language in first year of college and received an A grade for the same.</p>
        <img class="SEO" src="images/seo.png" alt="seopic">
        <br>
        <p>Content writing is something I thoroughly enjoy and Search Engine Optimization really amps up your content on the web! Having done internship in an editorial position, i am somewhat aware of how the process works and how to implement SEO in your content.</p>
